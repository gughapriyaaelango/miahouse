<h1>About Nia Shanks</h1>
<h2>I know what you’re thinking: Who are you? Why should I listen to you?</h2>
<p>Fair question indeed. To answer it, I must first ask you a question: Do you know how many minutes of vigorous exercise you would have to perform to burn off the calories from three cookies?</p>

<p>Who cares, because that is a stupid question.</p>

<p>Health and fitness — how you eat and move your body — is about empowerment; becoming the best version of yourself. Health and fitness should reduce your stress, build you up, and make your life better. It should show you the incredible things your body can do, and then leave you wanting to discover what else it is capable of.</p>

<p>As you’ll see, we use strength training as the main tool.</p>

<p>Nutrition is about eating well, simply. Not dieting. Not avoiding foods (because that leads to obsessive, disordered, and binge eating habits). Not feeling guilty when you indulge in your favorite dessert (or pizza, or whatever you love).</p>

<p>Health and fitness is not about “earning your food” or punishing yourself for eating. It’s about moving your body in ways you enjoy — getting stronger, and becoming more awesome. This journey should allow you to build a body you feel great occupying, and making sure you create habits so you can maintain that better-looking body long-term.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Build a Better Body & Become the Most Awesome Version of Yourself</h2>
<p>Health and fitness should be part of your life — it shouldn’t dominate it.</p>

<p>It should build you up, make you proud of what your body can do, and allow you to achieve your goals in the simplest way possible, and ensure you can maintain those results long-term.</p>

<p>You can get the short email-course that will jump-start this process.</p>

<p>Don’t waste any more time (or your sanity) searching for the latest and greatest workout or diet. Sign up for the short course and you’ll receive information you can apply today that will get you on the fast track to success. You’ll also be the first to know when new content is available.</p>

<p>Why should you sign up? Don’t take my word for it. Here’s what people are saying:</p>

<p>“I absolutely love your no nonsense simple approach to fitness and nutrition and I’m not exaggerating when I say it has changed my life. I have been doing your training programs for the last 1.5 + years and have seen more progress in that time than any other. And please keep up the great work and great training programs!!  Also, thank you for making them so affordable, it almost feels like I’m ripping you off!”— Kerry</p>
<p>“Nia, I wanted to tell you that you probably saved my life! Well, not literally, but really… Since I started your Simple Strength Program, changed my approach to lifting and eating, and focused more and more on my health and performance, I feel sanity and happiness coming back to my personal life and my life in the gym. Thank you for the great work you are doing! Keep it up.”— Carolin</p>
<p>“Out of every fitness contributor I’ve come across, you are the only person who truly helps me focus on what is important. I believe in getting stronger, and if other parts of me change physically to keep up with that — that’s awesome! Your approach helps me develop a more well-rounded sense of self, rather than focusing only on my superficial image. Mirrors no longer own me — I only care about how I feel in my own skin!— Katie</p>
